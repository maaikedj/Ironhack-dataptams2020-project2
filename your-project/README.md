## Project Description
Amsterdam is one of the most sustainable cities in the world: it is now ranking fifth on the Green City Index of European
capitals. The city council has sustainability high on the political agenda and actively promotes it by for example supporting projects promoting sustainability and subsidising certain sustainability efforts by citizens. Some examples of sustainability in Amsterdam: all trams and subways run on green electricity, and half of all hotel rooms have a high sustainability score. Also housing is becoming more sustainable, although the question arises whether more sustainable housing is more expensive. In this project we analyse sustainability indicators for the different areas of Amsterdam and whether it is related to wealth indicators such income and housing prices. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
We investigate the following questions: 
- How do sustainability indicators vary among different areas of Amsterdam?
- Is there a link between wealth indicators and sustainability indicators in Amsterdam?

We expect that some areas of Amsterdam are overall more sustainable than others, and that sustainability indicators might be positively correlated with wealth indicators such as house prices or income, so that wealthier areas score are more sustainable. 

## Datasets
We used the following datasets:

From the data portal of the Amsterdam city council [website](https://maps.amsterdam.nl/open_geodata/)
  * Green roofs (Groene daken)
  * Solar panels (Zonnepanelen)
  * City districts (Stadsdelen)
  * Postcodes to city areas and districts

From Overheid.nl:
 * [Energylabels in Amsterdam](https://data.overheid.nl/dataset/dc1c9286-fba7-4fd7-b55f-1a3f8cb3101e)

We used data on house prices from this [website](https://financieel.infonu.nl/geld/173129-huizenmarkt-van-amsterdam-prijzen-per-stadsdeel-en-per-m.html#amsterdam-centrum-oa-grachtengordel-en-jordaan)

All datasets can be found in this google folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15N97ElHfoyX_Pe7C3W0BGkCg3LbKdrP1

## Workflow
Starting with the general topic of sustainability, we searched for relevant datasets to see what's available, after which we refined our questions. We then broke down and planned the different phases of our project. Next, we wrote jupyter notebooks in python for different parts of the analysis. 

## Organization
We created a kanban board to plan the different steps of the project (see link below)
In the 'your_data' folder of the repository you can find the notebooks for the different part of the analysis.
